# DeepSeek Architecture Implementation from Scratch

A comprehensive learning journey to understand and implement the DeepSeek architecture, starting from fundamental attention mechanisms and building up to advanced concepts like MLA, MOE, MTP, Quantization, RoPE, and GRPO.

## Learning Objectives

Master the complete DeepSeek ecosystem by implementing each component from scratch:
- **Core Attention**: Self-attention → Causal → Multi-head → MLA
- **Advanced Architectures**: Mixture of Experts (MOE), Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)
- **Optimization Techniques**: Quantization, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)
- **Training Methods**: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

| Component | Implementation Details | Key Learnings |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| Self-Attention | Basic attention mechanism with Q/K/V projections | Fixed tensor operations with `transpose(-2, -1)`, Proper scaling with `sqrt(d_k)` |

### Current Focus

**Phase 2: Causal Attention** - Implementing autoregressive attention patterns with proper masking

## Testing Framework

| Test Category | Description | Coverage |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Unit Tests | Individual component testing | Shape verification, Gradient flow |
| Integration Tests | Component interaction testing | End-to-end workflows |
| Performance Tests | Efficiency benchmarking | Memory usage, Speed analysis |
| Comparison Tests | Reference implementation validation | PyTorch native comparisons |

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Self-Attention Insights
- **Tensor Operations**: Use `transpose(-2, -1)` for proper batched matrix operations
- **Scaling Factor**: `sqrt(d_k)` scaling ensures gradient stability
- **Dimension Tracking**: Always verify tensor shapes for debugging

### Development Strategy
1. **Foundation First**: Master basic concepts before advanced implementations
2. **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase builds upon previous work
3. **Practical Focus**: Working code with comprehensive tests
4. **Performance Awareness**: Consider efficiency throughout development
